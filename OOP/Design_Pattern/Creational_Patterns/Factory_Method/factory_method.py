"""
Factory Method - provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Motivation:

When to use?
Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and
dependencies of the objects your code should work with.
